# Text2Field v0.1

A computer vision project for detecting and segmenting soccer field elements using both classical CV and deep learning approaches.

## Overview

Text2Field is designed to identify and segment various components of a soccer field from images and videos, including:
- Field boundaries (First/Second half)
- Central circles
- 18-yard boxes and circles
- 5-yard boxes

The project implements two approaches:
1. **Classical Computer Vision**: HSV-based detection with ellipse fitting
2. **Deep Learning**: YOLOv8 segmentation model with adaptive training

## Features

- ðŸŽ¯ Multi-class segmentation of soccer field elements
- ðŸš€ Automatic hardware adaptation for training (CPU/MPS/CUDA)
- ðŸ’¾ Memory-aware batch size and model selection
- ðŸ“Š Interactive Jupyter interface for inference
- ðŸ”§ Pre-trained models available

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Text2Field_v0.1.git
cd Text2Field_v0.1

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

### Using Pre-trained Model

```python
# In Jupyter notebook
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load the model
model = YOLO('runs/segment/field_seg_64gb_n_20250802_214746/weights/best.pt')

# Run inference
results = model('sample1.png')
results[0].show()
```

### Training Your Own Model

Open `DL_learning_model.ipynb` and run the adaptive training:

```python
trainer = YOLOv8MPSTrainerAuto(dataset_path="./field-6")
model_path, results = trainer.train_adaptive(
    model_size='auto',  # Automatically selects based on system memory
    epochs=100,
    imgsz=640
)
```

## Dataset

The project uses a Roboflow dataset with 7 classes:
- 18Yard
- 18Yard Circle
- 5Yard
- First Half Central Circle
- First Half Field
- Second Half Central Circle
- Second Half Field

Dataset statistics:
- Training: 2,523 images
- Validation: 161 images
- Test: 101 images

## Hardware Requirements

Minimum:
- 8GB RAM
- Python 3.8+

Recommended:
- 16GB+ RAM
- GPU with CUDA support or Apple Silicon

The training script automatically adapts to available hardware.

## Results

The YOLOv8 model achieves high accuracy in detecting and segmenting field elements. Example results can be found in the `runs/segment/` directory after training.
